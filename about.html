      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Hello, my name is <strong>Pius Victor</strong>, the creator behind <strong>Devis Tech</strong>.  
        I am a passionate <strong>Frontend Developer</strong> with strong expertise in 
        <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong>. My goal is to transform ideas into 
        modern, responsive, and user-friendly websites that deliver excellent user experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over time, I have worked on different projects ranging from small business 
        websites to educational platforms, always ensuring that my work is clean, 
        professional, and aligned with client needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am continuously learning, improving, and expanding my skills to stay 
        ahead of web development trends. My focus is not just writing code but 
        also building <strong>digital experiences that leave lasting impressions</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside coding, I am dedicated to creativity, design, and collaborationâ€”values 
        that shape the kind of developer I am becoming. At Devis Tech, the vision 
        is to create a strong online presence for businesses and individuals 
        through quality web solutions.
